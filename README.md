# FormBuilder
FormBuilder is an innovative web application that empowers users to create customized forms effortlessly. With its user-friendly interface and intuitive drag-and-drop functionality, users can easily design personalized forms tailored to their specific needs.

The platform allows users to add various form elements such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, and more, enabling them to collect specific information from respondents. Additionally, FormBuilder provides the flexibility to rearrange and customize the appearance of the form elements, giving users full control over the form's layout.

Once the form is created, users can save it to their account, and the data is securely stored in a MongoDB database. This ensures that all the forms and their responses are safely preserved and can be accessed at any time.

Sharing forms with others is effortless with FormBuilder. The platform generates a unique link for each form, which users can share via email, social media, or any other preferred channel. Recipients can access the form using the provided link and conveniently submit their responses online.

FormBuilder's collaborative features make it an ideal tool for teams, businesses, educational institutions, and more. Multiple team members can work together on a form, view the responses, and analyze the collected data in real-time.

With FormBuilder, the process of form creation, sharing, and data collection becomes seamless, efficient, and hassle-free. Its ability to save forms and responses in the MongoDB database ensures data integrity and makes it a reliable and scalable solution for a wide range of form-building needs.
